# Task ID: 10
# Title: System: End-to-End Integration, Testing, and Deployment
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate all frontend and backend components, perform comprehensive end-to-end testing, and prepare the feature for deployment.
# Details:
Connect the live frontend components to the final backend API endpoints. Test the entire user journey: selecting a time range, running the analysis, viewing the summary dashboard, and drilling down into the detailed diagnostic view. Conduct performance testing to ensure the analysis completes within an acceptable timeframe. Document the final configuration and deployment process.

# Test Strategy:
Execute a full user acceptance test (UAT) scenario with real-world log data. Verify data consistency between the backend calculations and frontend visualizations. Confirm the asynchronous workflow is seamless and provides appropriate feedback to the user. Check for and resolve any integration bugs.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement User Database Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the necessary database table(s) to store user information, including username, hashed password, email, and timestamps.
### Details:
Use a migration tool to create a 'users' table. Columns should include 'id' (primary key), 'username' (unique, indexed), 'email' (unique, indexed), 'hashed_password' (string), 'created_at', and 'updated_at'. Ensure password hashes are stored, never plain text.

## 2. Develop User Registration API Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a public API endpoint (e.g., POST /api/users/register) that allows new users to create an account.
### Details:
The endpoint should accept a username, email, and password. It must validate the input (e.g., password complexity, valid email format), check for existing username/email, hash the password using bcrypt, and save the new user record to the database.

## 3. Implement User Login API Endpoint and JWT Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create an API endpoint (e.g., POST /api/auth/login) for users to authenticate and receive an access token.
### Details:
The endpoint should accept a username/email and a password. It will retrieve the user from the database, compare the provided password with the stored hash, and if they match, generate a JSON Web Token (JWT). The JWT should contain user identifiers (like user ID) and have an expiration time.

## 4. Develop Authentication Middleware for Protected Routes [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a middleware or decorator that can be applied to API endpoints to ensure only authenticated users can access them.
### Details:
The middleware should extract the JWT from the request's 'Authorization' header. It must then validate the token's signature and expiration. If valid, it should decode the payload to identify the user and attach the user object or ID to the request context.

## 5. Create a Protected 'Get Current User' Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a protected API endpoint (e.g., GET /api/users/me) that returns the details of the currently authenticated user.
### Details:
This endpoint will be protected by the authentication middleware. It will use the user information from the request context to fetch the user profile from the database (excluding sensitive data like the password hash) and return it as a JSON response.
